<h1 align="center">Minefield</h1>
I was tasked by the University of South Wales to develop a basic minefield (not minesweeper!) style program/game using C#.NET. The aim is to show how the use of variables and more complex data structures like arrays and lists, and a wide range of programming elements such as statements, loops, branches, procedures, and files, all need to work together to achieve the final goal.

<h2 align="left">Description</h1>

Higher marks required further independent development of the application. Marks were issued proportionately to the level of complexity, innovation, robustness and functionality that was achieved at submission. To further develop the minefield game program to offer additional functionality that showcases advanced programming skills, creativity, and ability to work and think independently.
